General
=======
* add plugin system (both dynamic & static plugin support)
  [if you want to work on it, ask Fingolfin about this, he already has done
  some planning. Also make sure that your system support 'static' plugins, too]
* revise the way "quit" is handled. Maybe add a global variable "g_quit" which
  we set when the application should be quit (e.g. when an EVENT_QUIT is
  received). This is useful if multiple levels of event loops have to be ended

GUI
===
* LAUNCHER: fix global options dialog to be properly persistent
* LAUNCHER: add more options to global options dialog
* LAUNCHER: add more options to game options dialog 

Audio
=====
* get the high quality resample code to work
   [Fingolfin has started work on this]
* add a command line/config file option for the output sample rate (to allow
  for output sample rates other than 22050 Hz, e.g. 44100). Code should do
  sanity checking (e.g. restrict to rates between 8000 - 65535 Hz)

SCUMM
=====
* fix C64 costume code
