About EScummVM
--------------
	The original ports (uptil 0.7.1) were made by Andreas Karlsson and Lars Persson.
	The main transition to 0.8.0CVS and all relevant changes were done by Jurgen Braam.
	Jurgen and Lars are currently working together to finalize the transfer to CVS.
   

Nescessary components
---------------------
	Building EScummVM yourself using the UIQ 2.1 framework is not an easy task!
	Lets just say the framework needs quite some time to set up and takes a while 
	to get used to. If you choose to continue you will need the following items: 

	- Symbian UIQ 2.1 Framework
	  http://www.symbian.com/developer/sdks_uiq.asp

	- ECompXL, an EPOC application compression library
	  http://www.yipton.demon.co.uk/ecompxl/latest/readme.html
	  
	- libsdl, Simple Directmedia Layer, a cross-platform multimedia library 
	  http://www.libsdl.org/ (see note about ESDL below)

	- libmad, a high-quality MPEG audio decoder
	  http://www.underbit.com/products/mad/ 
	
	- zlib, a massively spiffy yet delicately unobtrusive compression library
	  http://www.zlib.net/

	These are probably too heavy-duty for your phone:

	- libogg, the free media file container format
	  http://www.xiph.org/ogg/
	
	- libvorbis, the free audio codec
	  http://www.vorbis.com/
	  
	- flac, the Free Lossless Audio Codec
	  http://flac.sourceforge.net/
	  
	- libmpeg2, a free MPEG-2 video stream decoder
	  http://libmpeg2.sourceforge.net/


Building EScummVM
-----------------
	ECompXL: this is a tool that will compress your executable with GZIP and glue
	it to a predefined loader app. The app will uncompress your application at
	runtime and run it without you even knowing it. A really interesting byproduct
	of this method is that the general restriction of not having any writeable 
	static data (WSD) for Symbian APP executables no longer applies. This makes
	the life of an EPOC porter a lot easier! To install this tool you need to add
	its \bin path to your PATH above the sybmian epocs32\tools path, so that ECompXL's
	PETRAN.EXE will be the executable that is started.
	
	SDL: the latest varsion of SDL at this point in time is 1.2.8. This version 
	works great for compiling on other platforms, but for EPOC it lacks some 
	features. There are two distributions that have the nescessary goods: The one 
	made for SuperWaba (http://www.newlc.com/article.php3?id_article=574 and 
	http://www.superwaba.com/) and ESDL, the one that Sprawl made for the P800/P900. I've 
	used Sprawl's version uptil now. If Sprawl feels ESDL is in such a state that
	it can be released, he will post a source download on his site and I will
	make it know through the scummvm.org site. In <DevRoot>/sdl/epoc/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build
	
	zlib: the zlib-x.x.x.tar.gz does not come with UIQ .mpp build files, that's why 
	I added them for you in epoc-zlib.zip. Extract in <DevRoot>/zlib/ which will 
	create the epoc dir. In <DevRoot>/zlib/epoc/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build

	libmad: the libmad-x.x.x.tar.gz does not come with UIQ .mpp build files, that's
	why I added them for you in epoc-libmad.zip. Extract in <DevRoot>/libmad/ which 
	will create the epoc dir. In <DevRoot>/libmad/epoc/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build

	EScummVM: make sure the SYSTEMINCLUDE dirs in EScumVM.mmp are correct. For the 
	'wins' platform also check the LIBRARY entries for the correct path to your MSVC 
	installation. Please note that you can only specify relative paths here, so every-
	thing needs to be on the same physical drive! Another weird demand of the UIQ
	platform...	In <DevRoot>/scummvm/backends/epoc/build/ go:
	> bldmake bldfiles
	> abld build
	> makesis EScummVM_xxx.pkg
	
	Now you should have yourself a nice EScummVM_xxx.sis installer package for use 
	on your phone. Please note that for development it will be a lot faster if you
	transfer the ESCUMMVM.APP file directly to your !:\system\apps\EScummVM\ dir!

	Platforms can be one of: ARMi, ARM4, THUMB, WINS. The SE P900 uses the ARMi platform,
	which is a combined ARM4/THUMB programming mode. Configurations can be one of: 
	UREL or UDEB.


Greetz & such
-------------
	Kudos fly out to:
	- Sprawl for having the nerve to start & carry this puppy for so long
	- AnotherGuest for having the nerve to start & carry this puppy for so long
	- Fingolfin for taking the time to go through 1000 patch versions with me
	- Myself (SumthinWicked), for writing this entire README :)
	- the entire ScummVM Dev team for making a kicka$$ program
	- the folks in #scummvm @ irc.freenode.net for their help, confort and support
	- everybody else who wants to give me 'the look' for not including them here :P
	

	it's been swell,
	gotta go now,
	
	greetz,
