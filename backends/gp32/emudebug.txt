EmuDebug by Rafael Vuijk (aka Dark Fader)
Console debug output for emulators.
GBA apps must use the new debug library found in MyLib

Usage
-----
Please run program with '-h' parameter to get possible options.

How it works
------------
1) PC searches the debug buffer in emulators memory.
	begin & end init value is 0xEDEBEDEB, must reset to 0 to start debugging
	data all spaces except first and last character, which are '{' & '}'
2) GBA waits for begin/end to become something else than init value
3) GBA reads any characters until begin & end index are equal again

History
-------
v1.02
	minimizes window & pop-ups when debugging
	escape closes emulator window
	rotating buffer, so incompatable with older versions but who cares :)

v1.01
	waits for emulator at startup
	reconnects to new emulator instance
	window class/title options
	poll interval boosting
	option for minimum buffersize
	wait for key before searching option

v1.00
	'protocol' defined
	searches buffer in Boycott Advance
	console output
