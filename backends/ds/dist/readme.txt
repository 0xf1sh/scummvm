-----------------------------
Ported by Neil Millstone (agentq)

This is still a beta, so there's no full instructions yet.  Using it should be the
same as with version 0.61, except the build you need to use for your game may have
changed:

Please let me know of any bugs you find, and whether it runs on your card reader,
by posting in the forum below.  The driver has been updated for M3 and SD devices, 
so the compatibility may have improved, there is also now NinjaSD support.  Max 
Media Dock support is being worked on and will probably appear in the next beta.  
There is no G6 support.

Build A: All Lucasarts games
Build B: Beneath a Steel Sky, Flight of the Amazon Queen
Build C: Simon the Sorcerer 1/2, Legend of Kyrandia, Gobliiins

Here are the new features:
- New Games Supported: Simon the Sorcerer 2 and Legend of Kyrandia
- Made the DS turn off when you quit a game
- Updated flash device drivers
- Added a 200% scale option for the zoomed view
- Change zoom range for the zoomed view so you can zoom right out
- Speed increase!
- Fixed crashing when saving in Beneath a Steel Sky
- Fixed inventory not appearing in Beneath a Steel Sky
- Fixed incorrect colours in frontend
- Made frontend more responsive

The final version will be released when the rest of the ScummVM team release 0.9.1.
This should be within a month or so.
