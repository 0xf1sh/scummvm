Compiling ScummVM for SEGA Dreamcast
====================================

If you want to compile ScummVM for your Dreamcast,
you'll need the following:

* gcc-3.0.x configured as a cross-compiler for `sh-elf'
  (including corresponding binutils)

* newlib for sh-elf : <URL:http://mc.pp.se/dc/files/newlib-1.9.0.tar.gz>

* libronin-0.3 : <URL:http://peter.bortas.org/scumm/libronin-0.3.tar.gz>

* GNU make


Edit the Makefile to contain the path to libronin if you installed it
somewhere other than /usr/local/ronin, then run `make', and you should
get an ELF binary with the name `scummvm'.
