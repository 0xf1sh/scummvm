ScummVM-PS2 0.8.0 Release Candidate 1 Readme
============================================

You need a Playstation2 with a modchip of your choice in order to run ScummVM.

ScummVM expects the game data on the CD-R, other devices like USB sticks
 and HDD are currently unsupported.

In order to use a USB Mouse and USB Keyboard, you need Sony's USB driver,
 the USBD.IRX.  Copy it from a PS2 game that supports USB devices, like
 Eye Toy or Singstar. 
The demo disc that came with my PS2 also had it.
 Put it into the directory in which you extracted the .zip file.
You can also use ScummVM without the USB driver but you can only use the
 Gamepad in that case.


Creating a CD-R using CD-Tool
=============================
Copy any games you want on the CD over into the directory where you extracted
 the ZIP file. Don't copy any files directly into the directory of the
 ScummVM.ELF, those files are ignored. Instead, have each game in its own
 directory.
File- and directorynames should be DOS 8+3, if they aren't, they'll get
 renamed.

If you run windows, just double click the make_iso.bat.
Wait while it creates the ISO image and burn it with Nero
or any other CD writing software.

For Linux or Mac OS X binaries check http://www.nobis-crew.org/cd-tool/

Unfortunately, writing DVD images with cd-tool is currently broken and will
 crash when it reaches the 2GB limit. This problem will probably be fixed in
 the nearer future.


Notes
=====
- CD swapping doesn't work, unfortunately. So you should have all games
   on the CD you booted from.
- Curse of Monkey Island is unsupported. iMuse digital crashes often, 
   especially during Sea battles.
- Zlib is unsupported, so compressed SAN files won't work.
- The cd/dvd drive is a bottleneck, that's why you should compress the games
   with MP3 or Ogg/Vorbis using compress_scumm_sou / compress_scumm_bun /
   compress_sword1 / compress_sword2 etc, but *not* compress_san as it
   requires zlib. Besides, uncompressed SAN files play fine.
- I haven't had time to implement a virtual keyboard. If you don't have a USB
   keyboard, you can only enter '1's using the Select button.
- When you see '1's and '0's flying across your screen, it means ScummVM is
   accessing the Memory Card. Don't switch off or reset the console in that
   case, and don't remove the Memory Card either :P
