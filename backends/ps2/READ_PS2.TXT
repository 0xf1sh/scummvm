ScummVM-PS2 0.8.0 Release Candidate 3 Readme
============================================

You need a PlayStation 2 with a modchip of your choice in order to run ScummVM.

ScummVM expects the game data either on CD-R/DVD-R or on the Harddisk.
 It tries to mount the partition hdd0:+ScummVM on startup and basically treats
 it in the same way as the DVD drive.
 Creating the partition and putting the datafiles there is up to you.

In order to use a USB Mouse and USB Keyboard, you need Sony's USB driver,
 the USBD.IRX.  As it is Sony property, we can not offer it for download.
 Later versions of the USBD apparently are incompatible. It should work if
 the file is smaller than ~30 KB.
I am using the USBD from the Demo Disc that was shipped with my PS2.
You can also use ScummVM without the USB driver but you can only use the
 Gamepad in that case.


Creating a CD-R using CD-Tool
=============================
Copy any games you want on the CD over into the directory where you extracted
 the ZIP file. Don't copy any files directly into the directory of the
 ScummVM.ELF, those files are ignored. Instead, have each game in its own
 directory.
File- and directorynames should be DOS 8+3, if they aren't, they'll get
 renamed.

If you run windows, just double click the make_iso.bat.
Wait while it creates the ISO image and burn it with Nero
or any other CD writing software.

For Linux or Mac OS X binaries check http://www.nobis-crew.org/cd-tool/

Unfortunately, writing DVD images with cd-tool is currently broken.
 This problem will probably be fixed in the nearer future.


Notes
=====
- The Curse of Monkey Island only works correctly from HDD.
   Playing it from CD/DVD will initially seem to work, but you will
   experience random crashes.
- Compressed SAN files need a lot of CPU power, probably because of zlib,
   and are constantly out of sync. Uncompressed SANs play fine though, so
   compress_san is NOT recommended.
- The cd/dvd drive is a bottleneck, that's why you should compress the games
   with MP3 or Ogg/Vorbis using compress_scumm_sou / compress_scumm_bun /
   compress_sword1 / compress_sword2 etc, but NOT compress_san.
- I haven't had time to implement a virtual keyboard. If you don't have a USB
   keyboard, you can only enter '1's using the Select button.
   (for copy protection screens as well as savegame names)
- When you see '1's and '0's flying across your screen, it means ScummVM is
   accessing the Memory Card. Don't switch off or reset the console in that
   case, and don't remove the Memory Card either :P
