# THIS SCRIPT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING YET!
#
# Some things this script could/should do when finished
#
# * detect the compiler name (g++/c++/...)
# * detect whether its a GNU compiler or not (for compiler settings)
# * detect the host platform and base settings on this:
#   - #defines like -DUNIX and -DMACOSX
#   - required libs like -lmingw32
# * command line options to...
#   - override the host settings (for cross compiles
#   - select the desired backend (sdl, x11, ...)
#   - whether to dump scripts (sets -DDUMP_SCRIPTS)
#   - whether mad should be used (--enabled-mad) -> set LIBS/DEFINES
# * detect whether the chose backend is available (e.g. call sdl-config)
# * detect whether mad/ALSA/... are available
# * detect endianess and write that into config.h
# * detect size of data types and write that into config.h
# * ....
