\subsection{The Curse of Monkey Island notes}

For this game, you'll need the comi.la0, comi.la1 and comi.la2 files. The
comi.la0 file can be found on either CD, but since they are identical it
doesn't matter which one of them you use.

In addition, you'll need a resource subdirectory with all of the files from the
resource subdirectories on both CDs. Some of the files appear on both CDs, but
again they're identical.
