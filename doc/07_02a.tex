\subsection{Playing sound with MT-32 emulation}

Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks designed
for MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this card, however you should
provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work. Put the roms in game directory or
directory specified by extrapath.

You don't need to specify --native-mt32 with this driver, as it automatically
gets turned on.

\textbf{NOTE:} You need to have enough processor power to use this emulator as
 it uses heavy floating-point computations.
