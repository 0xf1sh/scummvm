\subsection{Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb notes}
In order to run the Mac OS X Wyrmkeep re-release of the game you will need to
copy over data from the CD to your hard drive. If you're on a PC then consult:

  \url{http://wiki.scummvm.org/index.php/HOWTO-Mac_Games}

Although it primarily talks about SCUMM games, it mentions the "HFVExplorer"
utility which you need to extract the files.
Note that you have to put the speech data "Inherit the Earth Voices" in the
same directory as the game data which is stored in:

\begin{verbatim}
  Inherit the Earth.app/Contents/Resources
\end{verbatim}

For the old Mac OS 9 release you need to copy the files in MacBinary format,
as they should include both resource and data forks. Copy all 'ITE *' files.
