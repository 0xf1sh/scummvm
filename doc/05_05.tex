\subsection {Using data files from Macintosh game versions}
All LucasArts SCUMM based adventures except CMI also exist in versions for the
Macintosh. ScummVM can use most (all?) of them, however, in some case some
additional work is required. First off, if you are not using a Macintosh for
this, accessing the CD/floppy data might be tricky, since the mac uses a 
special disk format called HFS which other systems usually do not support.
However, there are various free tools on the net which allow reading such HFS
volumes (for example "HFVExplorer" for Windows and "hfsutils" for Linux and
other Unix-like operating systems).

Secondly, most of the newer games shipped only with a  single data file on the
Macintosh. You used to have to manually convert that data file, but this is no
longer necessary, as ScummVM can now open and understand the format natively.
