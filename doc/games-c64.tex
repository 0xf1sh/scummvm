\subsection{Commodore64 games notes}

Both Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken run but Maniac Mansion is not yet
playable. Either use extract\_mm\_c64 from the tools package (but then the
game will not be autodetected by ScummVM) or name the D64 disks as
"maniac1.d64", "maniac2.d64" and "zak1.d64", "zak2.d64" respectively.
If you add the game manually, make sure that the platform is set to
Commodore64.
