\subsection{Copy Protection}

he ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases when
LucasArts themselves bundled cracked interpreters with their own games --
the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter
bypasses them. There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate
and pirated data files, so for the games where we know the original interpreter
may have been cracked ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection.\\

At the time of writing, that includes the following games:\\
\begin{tabular}{l}
Indiana Jones \& the Last Crusade (EGA)\\
Indiana Jones \& the Last Crusade (256 color FM Towns version)\\
Loom (16 color floppy version)\\
Maniac Mansion\\
Monkey Island 1 (EGA)\\
Monkey Island 1 (VGA)\\
Monkey Island 2\\
Zak McKracken (EGA)\\
Zak McKracken (256 color FM Towns version)\\
\\
Beneath a Steel Sky (bypassed with permission from Revolution)\\
\\
\end{tabular}\\
In most cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering
any answer. Chances are that it will work.
