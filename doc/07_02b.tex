\subsection{Playing sound with FluidSynth MIDI emulation}

If ScummVM was build with libfluildsynth support it will be able to play MIDI
music through the FluidSynth driver. You will have to specify a SoundFont to
use, however.

\textbf{NOTE:} The processor requirements for FluidSynth can be fairly high in
some cases. A fast CPU is recommended.
