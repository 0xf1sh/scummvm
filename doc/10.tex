John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis for sharing the source of their classic title, Flight of the Amazon Queen and also being incredibly supportive.

Joe Pearce from The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. for sharing the source of their famous title Inherit the Earth and always prompt replies to our questions.
