\subsection{Copy Protection}

The ScummVM team does not condone piracy. However, there are cases when
LucasArts themselves bundled cracked interpreters with their own games --
the data files still contain the copy protection scripts, but the interpreter
bypasses them. There is no way for us to tell the difference between legitimate
and pirated data files, so for the games where we know the original interpreter
may have been cracked ScummVM will always have to bypass the copy protection.

In some cases ScummVM will still show the copy protection screen. Try entering
any answer. Chances are that it will work.

ScummVM will skip copy protection in the following games:

\begin{tabular}{l}
Maniac Mansion\\
Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders\\
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (EGA)\\
Loom (EGA)\\
The Secret of Monkey Island (EGA)\\
The Secret of Monkey Island (VGA)\\
Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge\\
\end{tabular}

Beneath a Steel Sky bypassed with kind permission from Revolution Software.

Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb (Floppy version) bypassed with kind
permission from Wyrmkeep Entertainment, since it was bypassed in all CD
releases of the game.
