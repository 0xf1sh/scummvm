\subsection{Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 notes}
The Simon the Sorcerer 1 \& 2 games were split into several targets to make
coding easier and to make it more clear which target should be used:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
       simon1acorn  & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 for Acorn (CD)\\
       simon1dos    & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 for DOS (Disk)\\
       simon2dos    & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 for DOS (Disk)\\
       simon1talkie & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie (DOS/Windows)\\
       simon2talkie & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie (Amiga/DOS/Macintosh/Windows)\\
\end{tabular}

Also make sure that the platform setting is correct!
If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD,
then you will find the Windows version in the main directory of CD
and the DOS Talkie version in the DOS directory of the CD.
