\subsection{Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2 notes}
The following three game targets were removed in ScummVM 0.7.x:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 simon1win    - Used for Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie (Windows)\\
 simon2win    - Used for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie (Windows)\\
 simon2mac    - Used for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie (Amiga or Mac)\\
\end{tabular}

If you were using these three targets the games will no longer load or
error out. Each game should be removed and added again via the launcher
to correct the targets used.

The current game targets are:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
 simon1acorn  & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 for Acorn (CD)\\
 simon1dos    & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 for DOS (Disk)\\
 simon2dos    & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 for DOS (Disk)\\
 simon1talkie & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 1 Talkie (DOS/Windows)\\
 simon2talkie & Use for Simon the Sorcerer 2 Talkie (Amiga/DOS/Mac/Windows)\\
\end{tabular}

Also make sure that the platform setting is correct, since it is used
to tell the difference between the various ports of the games.

If you have the dual version of Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2 on CD,
then you will find the Windows version in the main directory of CD
and the DOS Talkie version in the DOS directory of the CD.
