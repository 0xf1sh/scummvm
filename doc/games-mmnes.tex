\subsection{Maniac Mansion NES notes}

Supported versions are English GB (E), French (F), German (G), Swedish (SW)
and English US (U).
ScummVM requires just the PRG section to run and not the whole ROM.

In order to get the game working, you will have to strip out the first
16 bytes from the ROM you are trying to work with. Any hex editor will work
as long as you are able to copy/paste.  After you open the ROM with the
hex editor, copy everything from the second row (17th byte) to the end.
After you do this, paste it to a new hex file. Name the new file
"Maniac Mansion (XX).prg" while XX stands for the version you are working
with (E, F, G, SW, or U).  The final size should be exactly 262144 bytes.

If you add the game manually make sure that the platform is set to NES.

Most common mistakes which prevents the game from running:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bad file
  \item ROM extracted with the 0.7.0 tools
  \item You try to feed ScummVM with the FULL ROM and not just the PRG section.
\end{itemize}

It is also possible to extract the separate LFL files from the PRG section.
To do so use the extract\_mm\_nes utility from the tools package.
