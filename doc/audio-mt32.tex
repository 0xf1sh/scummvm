\subsection{Playing sound with MT-32 emulation}

Some games which contain MIDI music data also have improved tracks designed
for the MT-32 sound module. ScummVM can now emulate this device, however you
must provide original MT-32 ROMs to make it work:

MT32\_PCM.ROM     - IC21 (512KB)\\
MT32\_CONTROL.ROM - IC26 (32KB) and IC27 (32KB), interleaved byte-wise\\

Place these ROMs in the game directory, in your extrapath, or in the directory
where your ScummVM executable resides.

You don't need to specify --native-mt32 with this driver, as it automatically
gets turned on.

\textbf{NOTE:} The processor requirements for the emulator are quite high; a fast CPU is
 strongly recommended.
