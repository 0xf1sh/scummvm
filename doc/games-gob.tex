\subsection{Gobliiins notes}

The CD versions of the Gobliiins series contain one big audio track which you
need to rip (See the section on using compressed audio files) and copy into
the game directory if you want to have in-game music without the CD in the
drive all the time. The speech is also in that track and its volume is
therefore changed with the music volume control as well.
