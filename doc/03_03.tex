\subsection {Broken Sword notes}
Broken Sword 1 and 2 both come with in-game cutscenes compressed using 
RAD Game Tools legacy Smacker(tm) format. As RAD is unwilling to open
the older legacy versions of this format to us, and have requested we not
reverse engineer it, Revolution Software has kindly allowed us to provide
re-encoded Broken Sword cutscenes for download on our website.

These cutscenes are provided in MPEG2 format with OGG Vorbis audio.
Viewing these cutscenes thus requires a version of ScummVM compiled 
with both libmpeg2 (preferably 0.4.0 or greater) and libVorbis support.

The cutscenes should be placed in the main game data directory. Note that
currently this requires either copying the game to harddisk or reburning
customised versions of the game CDs.
