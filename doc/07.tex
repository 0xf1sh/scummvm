\section{Music and Sound}
By default, on most operating systems, ScummVM will automatically use Adlib
emulation. MIDI may not be available on all operating systems or may need
manual configuration. If you ARE using MIDI, you have several different
choices of output, depending on your operating system and configuration.

\begin{tabular}[h]{ll}
  adlib     & Uses internal Adlib Emulation (default)\\
  mt32      & Uses internal MT-32 Emulation\\
  pcjr      & Uses internal PCjr Emulation \\
  pcspk     & Uses internal PC Speaker Emulation\\
  towns     & Uses FM-TOWNS YM2612 Emulation\\
  windows   & Windows MIDI. Uses built-in sequencer, for Windows users\\
  seq       & Uses /dev/sequencer for MIDI, *nix users. See below.\\
  qt        & Quicktime sound, for Macintosh users.\\
  core      & CoreAudio sound, for MacOS X users.\\
  amidi     & Uses the MorphOS MIDI system, for MorphOS users\\
  alsa      & Output using ALSA sequencer device. See below.\\
  null      & Null output. Don't play any music.\\
\end{tabular}

To select a sound driver, pass its name via the '-e' option to scummvm,
for example:
\begin{verbatim}
   scummvm -e adlib monkey2
\end{verbatim}
