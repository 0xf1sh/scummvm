\subsection{The Feeble Files notes}
If you have the Windows version of The Feeble Files, there are two things to
note. First of all, more than 300 files, most of them necessary for the game to
run, are stored in a file called data1.cab. ScummVM does not know how to unpack
this file, so you will probably have to let the original installer do it.

Secondly, the game uses Smacker cutscenes extensively. For reasons described
above, we cannot support these directly. They have to be re-encoded to DXA,
which is the format used for the Macintosh and Amiga cutscenes. See the tools
README for further details about this.
