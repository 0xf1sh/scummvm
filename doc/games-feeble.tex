\subsection{The Feeble Files notes}

If you have the Windows version of The Feeble Files, there are several things
to note. 

Many of the files necessary for the game are stored in an InstallShield file
called data1.cab, which ScummVM is unable to unpack. You will need to use the
original installer or i5comp to unpack the contents of this file.

The game uses Smacker cutscenes extensively, which we can't support directly,
due to reasons described above. The cutscenes have to be re-encoded to DXA,
which is the format used by the cutscenes in the Amiga and Macintosh versions.
See thetools README for a brief guide on converting the cutscenes.

The original speech files will need to be renamed, to use with ScummVM.
Rename voices.wav on CD1 to voices1.wav
Rename voices.wav on CD2 to voices2.wav
Rename voices.wav on CD3 to voices3.wav
Rename voices.wav on CD4 to voices4.wav
