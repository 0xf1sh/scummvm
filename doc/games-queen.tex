\subsection{Flight of the Amazon Queen notes}

In order to use a non-freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen (from
original CD), you will need to place the 'queen.tbl' file (available from the
Compatibility page on our website) in either the directory containing the
'queen.1' game data file, in your extrapath, or in the directory where your
ScummVM executable resides.

Alternatively, you can use the 'compress\_queen' tool from the tools package to
'rebuild' your FOTAQ data file to include the table for that specific version,
and thus removing the run-time dependency on the 'queen.tbl' file.
This tool also allows you to compress the speech and sound effects with MP3,
OGG or FLAC.
