\subsection{Flight of the Amazon Queen notes}
In order to use a non-freeware version of Flight of the Amazon Queen (i.e.
your own), you will need to have the 'queen.tbl' file (available from the
Compatibility page on our website) in either the directory containing the
'queen.1' datafile or in the directory where your ScummVM executable resides.
                  
Alternatively, you can use the 'compress\_queen' tool from the Tools module to
'rebuild' your FOTAQ datafile to include the table for that specific version,
and thus removing the run-time dependency on the 'queen.tbl' file. 
This tool also allows you to compress the speech and sound effects with MP3,
OGG or FLAC.
