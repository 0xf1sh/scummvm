\subsection{Reporting Bugs}

To report a bug, please create a SourceForge account and follow the bugs
link from our homepage. Please make sure the bug is reproducible, and
still occurs in the latest daily build/current CVS version. Also check
the known bugs list (below) and compatibility listing for that game, to
ensure the issue is not already known.\\
\quad \\
Also do not report bugs on games that are not listed as being completable
in the 'Supported Games' section, or compatibility list. We -know- those
games have bugs.\\
%
Please include the following information:
\begin{itemize}
\item ScummVM version (PLEASE test the latest CVS/Daily build)
\item Bug details, including instructions on reproducing
\item Language of game (English, German, ...)
\item Version of game (talkie, floppy, ...)
\item Platform and Compiler (Win32, Linux, FreeBSD, ...)
\item Attach a save game if possible
\item If this bug only occurred recently, please note the last
          version without the bug, and the first version including
          the bug. That way we can fix it quicker by looking at the
          changes made.
\end{itemize}
