\section{About}

ScummVM is a collection of interpreters, capable of emulating several
adventure game engines. ScummVM mainly supports games created using
SCUMM (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion), used in various
LucasArts games such as Monkey Island and numerous Humongous Entertainment
games.

ScummVM also contains interpreters for several non-SCUMM games. Currently
these are Beneath a Steel Sky, Broken Sword 1 and 2, Flight of the
Amazon Queen, Gobliiins, Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb,
Simon the Sorcerer 1 and 2, The Feeble Files and The Legend of Kyrandia.

At this time ScummVM should be considered beta software, and is still
under heavy development. Be aware that whilst we attempt to make sure
that many games can be completed with few major bugs, crashes can happen.

If you enjoy ScummVM feel free to donate using the PayPal button on the
ScummVM homepage. This will help us buy utilities needed to develop ScummVM
easier and quicker. If you cannot donate, help and contribute a patch!
