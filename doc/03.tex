\section{Supported Games}

At the moment the following games have been reported to work, and should
be playable to the end. However, this list generally applies to PC versions.
Mac versions usually should work, too (with some exceptions for older games),
and Amiga versions of games may work with the 'Amiga' flag turned on -- but
this is not always true.
