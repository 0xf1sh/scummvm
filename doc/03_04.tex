Beneath a Steel Sky:

  \item ScummVM 0.5.0 contained a bug in the savegame system.
                  If you experience problems using an old savegame, it may be
                  corrupt, and you will need to start a new game using this
                  version.

  \end{itemize}
Simon the Sorcerer 2:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Combined speech and subtitles will often cause speech to be
                  cut off early, this is limitation of original game.
  \item Only default language (English) in data files is supported
                  in simon2mac
  \item F10 key animation in simon2mac is different compared to
                  original game
  \end{itemize}
FM-TOWNS versions:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Kanji versions require the FM-TOWNS Font ROM
  \item All the FM-TOWNS versions of games are extremely rare,
                  And as the ScummVM team does not encourage piracy in any
                  way, we don't know where to buy or download a copy of these
                  games. Petition LucasArts to re-release them :)
  \end{itemize}
All CD games:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If you are experiencing random crashes, and your game
                 plays music from CD, you have encountered a Windows bug.
                 Try copying the data files from CD to your hard disk, and
                 running them from there.
  \end{itemize}
