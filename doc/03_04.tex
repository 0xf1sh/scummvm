\subsection{Known Problems in ScummVM 0.7.1}

This release has the following known problems. There is no need to report them,
although patches to fix them are welcome. If you discover a bug that is not
listed here, nor in the compatibility table on the web site, please see
section \ref{sect-reporting-bugs}.

CD Audio Games:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When playing games that use CD Audio (Towns variants, Loom CD, etc),
            users of Microsoft Windows 2000/XP may experience random crashes.
            This is due to a long-standing Windows bug, resulting in corrupt
            game files being read from the CD. Please copy the game data to
            your harddrive to avoid this.
  \end{itemize}

Monkey Island 1 (EGA):
Loom (EGA):
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MIDI support requires the Roland update from LucasArts
  \end{itemize}

Beneath a Steel Sky:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Not a bug: CD version is missing speech for some dialog, this is
            normal.
  \end{itemize}
