\section{Supported Platforms}
ScummVM has been ported to run on many platforms and operating systems.
Links to these ports can be found either on the ScummVM web page or by a
Google search. Many thanks to the effort of porters. If you have a port of
ScummVM and wish to commit it into the main CVS, feel free to contact us!

The Dreamcast port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, nor The Dig.
The PalmOS port does not support Curse of Monkey Island, Beneath a Steel
Sky, nor either Simon the Sorcerer 1 or 2. The Dig will only work on some
Palm devices (those with a large dynamic heap).

In the Macintosh port, the right mouse button is emulated via Cmd-Click (that
is, you click the mouse button while holding the Command/Apple/Propeller key).
