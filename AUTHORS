       Tony Warriner and everyone at Revolution Software Ltd. for sharing
       with us the source of some of their brilliant games, allowing us to
       release Beneath a Steel Sky as freeware... and generally being
       supportive above and beyond the call of duty.

       John Passfield and Steve Stamatiadis for sharing the source of their
       classic title, Flight of the Amazon Queen and also being incredibly
       supportive.

       Aric Wilmunder, Ron Gilbert, David Fox, Vince Lee, and all those at
       LucasFilm/LucasArts who made SCUMM the insane mess to reimplement
       that it is today. Feel free to drop us a line and tell us what you
       think, guys!
