README FOR THE MAC CARBON PORT

Runs on Mac OS X 10.1 (could also run on 10.0.x, but not tested), and Mac OS 8.6 or later (with CarbonLib
installed).

HOW TO COMPILE?
Launch the scummvm.mcp file in CodeWarrior and choose one of the Targets to compile. For just playing,
you should choose "ScummVM Final", the Debug one is just for Developing.
Also, when it runs stable, I will put some Binaries at our Site.

CHANGES:
- Thanks to Florent Boudet, QuickTime MIDI has been added, although it currently only works with DOTT

BUGS:
- No SFX-Sound support at all
- Music only works in DOTT
- On OS X it got some Problems with KeyDown-Events (hope I get them fixed)
- Bad behaviour of the Application towards other, will be fixed soon.
- Some minor bugs

If you find any bugs, just make a Bug Report on our SourceForge Page.
