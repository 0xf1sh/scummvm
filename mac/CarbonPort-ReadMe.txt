README FOR THE MAC CARBON PORT

Runs on Mac OS X 10.1 (could also run on 10.0.x, but not tested), and Mac OS 8.6 or later (with CarbonLib
installed).

HOW TO COMPILE?
Launch the scummvm.mcp file in CodeWarrior and choose one of the Targets to compile. For just playing,
you should choose "ScummVM Final", the Debug one is just for Developing.
Also, when it runs stable, I will put some Binaries at our Site.

BUGS:
- No Sound support at all
- On OS X it got some Problems with KeyDown-Events (hope I get them fixed)
- Some minor bugs

If you find any bugs, just make a Bug Report on our SourceForge Page.
