Description: SDL implementation of LucasArts' S.C.U.M.M. interpreter
 S.C.U.M.M. (Script Creation Utility for Maniac Mansion) is the engine
 used to create a lot of classic LucasArts adventure games, such as
 Sam & Max and The Secret of Monkey Island.
 .
 ScummVM lets you play your old adventure games in Debian, using SDL
 for the graphic presentation.
 .
 In addition to the various LucasArts-games ScummVM can play, it is also
 possible to use ScummVM with AdventureSoft's Simon the Sorcerer. For
 a full list of compatible games; see the official compatibility list at
 http://scummvm.sf.net/compatibility.php .
 .
 The data files belonging to the various games is not included in this
 package due to licensing issues; you have to obtain them somewhere else
 if you want ScummVM to be of any use.
